# The Keep Going Club Website

This repository contains the static website for **The Keep Going Club**, a grassroots mental-health movement based in Nottingham. The site introduces the club, shares its mission, highlights volunteer stories, and invites supporters and volunteers to get involved.

## Project Overview
- **Index page (`index.html`)**: Welcomes visitors, explains who the club is, outlines the mission, and links to Instagram for real-time updates.
- **About page (`about.html`)**: Shares the club's values, tells Maxi’s story, and showcases the volunteer team with visual avatars.
- **Support page (`support.html`)**: Describes ways businesses can support the club, displays current supporters in a marquee, and includes calls to action for partnerships and volunteering.
- **Global styling (`style.css`)**: Defines the site’s layout, responsive behavior, typography, and themed section colors to match the club’s brand.
- **Assets (`assets/`)**: Contains icons, photos, supporter logos, and the supporter carousel JavaScript.
