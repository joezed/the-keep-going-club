							<h2>How Businesses Can Support The Keep Going Club</h2>
							<br>
							<p>We’re a grassroots mental-health charity in Nottingham, creating events and creative safe spaces to help people breathe, connect, and, well, keep going.
							<br>We see people, not diagnoses. Every story matters, every experience is valid, and every person deserves compassion.
							</p>
							<br>
							
							<p>Your business can support us by:<br>
							- Sponsoring an event (help us afford tea, art supplies, and the occasional emergency biscuit run)<br>
							- Donating goods or services<br>
							- Hosting a fundraiser<br>
							- Letting us borrow your space for workshops or wellbeing sessions<br>
							</p>
							<br>
							
							<p>What you get in return:<br>
							- Shoutouts on our socials<br>
							- Your logo on our site<br>
							- Public appreciation (the wholesome kind)<br>
							- A warm fuzzy feeling inside<br>
							</p>

								Volunteers help us run events, welcome people, bring creative ideas, and keep the vibes friendly.
								No experience needed—just kindness, enthusiasm, and maybe the ability to locate a pen when someone inevitably asks for one.
