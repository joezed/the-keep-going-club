							<h2>About The Keep Going Club</h2>
							<br>
							<p>🧡 Human First
							<br>We see people, not diagnoses. Every story matters, every experience is valid, and every person deserves compassion.
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>🤝 Connection Over Correction
							<br>People don’t always need fixing; they need understanding. We listen first, hold space, and meet people exactly where they are.
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>🗣️ Speak Honestly
							<br>No filter. No jargon. Just real, honest conversations. Speaking openly can save lives.
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>✨ Hope With Humour
							<br>Healing can hold lightness too. Laughter, creativity and warmth are part of the journey, not a distraction from it.

									MAXI’S STORY — FOREVER 28 ❤️
									<br><br>
									Keep Going Club exists because of Maxi.
									<br><br>
									Maxi was the friend who showed up for everyone. She was ambitious, kind, gentle, and gloriously feisty in all the best ways - the type of person who lit up every room and put others before herself without ever thinking twice.
									<br><br>
									In December 2022, Maxi took her own life. Losing her changed everything for the people who loved her. It opened our eyes to the truth that someone can be the brightest light in the room and still be fighting battles no one can see.
									<br><br>
									Keep Going Club was created in her name and in her memory — to honour her, to carry forward her compassion, and to build the kind of support she deserved.
									A place for quiet struggles.
									A place for honesty and connection.
									A place for people who keep going, even when it’s hard.
									<br><br>
									This is for Maxi.
									Forever 28. ❤️
